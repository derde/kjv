Scripts to download the noxious NIV1984 from one of the internet places where
it remains in print. This work has no eternal value, but it may prove useful

    http://classic.studylight.org/desk/?l=en&query=Matthew+1&section=0&translation=niv&oq=Psalms%252059%253b1Samuel%252019%3A11-18&new=1&nb=ps&ng=59&ncc=59

Since the nature of the beast is that it is decorated with headings,
indentations and footnotes, it may be best to preserve it in all its misleading
glory, rather than attempting to reformat it in a meaningful way.
